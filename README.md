# Hierarchical vs Flat Machine Learning for Intrusion Detection

## Overview
This research project compares **Flat** and **Hierarchical** machine learning approaches for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) using the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**.

We investigate whether decomposing attack detection into a two-stage pipeline improves:

- Rare attack detection
- Macro F1-score
- Robustness under class imbalance
- Overall system reliability

---

## 🎯 Research Question

> Does a hierarchical classification framework outperform a flat multi-class classifier for intrusion detection?

---

## 🏗 Architecture

### 🔵 Flat Model

- Single multi-class classifier
- Direct prediction of attack category
- RandomForest + Optuna tuning
- SMOTENC + Undersampling


---

### 🔴 Hierarchical Model

#### Stage 1 — Binary Detection

- XGBoost
- Attack vs Normal
- Class-weighted training
- Threshold-based prediction (default = 0.3)


---

#### Stage 2 — Attack Refinement

Triggered only if Stage 1 predicts **Attack**

- Trained only on attack samples
- RandomForest
- Hyperparameter tuning via Optuna
- Adaptive resampling (target_count)
- SMOTENC balancing


## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **xgboot**
- **imblearn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Optuna** (for advanced optimization)

## Results & Insights
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in **Machine Learning**, **feature engineering**, and **hyperparameter tuning**. The use of **PSO** provided an insightful comparison to traditional methods, demonstrating the potential of metaheuristic approaches in ML.
